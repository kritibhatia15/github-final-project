A calculator that calculates simple interest given principal, annual rate of interest and time period in years.

Input:
p, principal amount t, time period in years r, annual rate of interest

Output
simple interest = p*t*r
compound interest 
A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}

Where:
	•	A = final amount (principal + interest)
	•	P = principal amount (initial investment)
	•	r = annual interest rate (in decimal, so 5% = 0.05)
	•	n = number of times interest is compounded per year
	•	t = number of years


Compound Interest = A - P
